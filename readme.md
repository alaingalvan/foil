‚ú® Foil is an _content management system_ designed for engineers, artists, technical artists, musicians, and bloggers looking to showcase a portfolio of front-end experiments, games, art, articles, and more.

It's built on top of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

## Getting started

### üåü Installation

Install the following prior to running foil:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Version 16 LTS or higher.

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Version 13 or higher.

- [Rust Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (optional) - The language the server and builder are written in. _This isn't necessary if you run foil directly from a binary_.

From there, visit the [releases](/releases) page for built binaries, and expose the `/bin` folder to your `PATH`.

### ‚ú® Usage

```bash
# üõ†Ô∏è Build your foil project, both the frontend and the portfolio, whatever's changed recently.
foil-cli build

# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è start the foil server.
foil-cli server start
```
